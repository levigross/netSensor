0.8.1 (October 26th, 2011)

  * New features:

    * Build infrastructure:

      * Added Mac OS X support (assumes an installation of Berkeley DB 4.4 from
        MacPorts).

    * Libraries:

      * Added a sensor DNS library (sensor/include/dns.*) for reverse DNS
        resolution.

      * Sensor SMTP library (sensor/include/smtp.*):

        * Modified the subject() and message() member functions to return
          std::ostringstream objects that can be used to set the subject and
          message of an e-mail, respectively. This is believed to make using
          the library easier.

    * Sensor modules:

      * Added PPS module (sensor/modules/pps), which monitors the inbound and
        outbound packet rates of IPv4 addresses on an arbitrary number of
        IPv4 networks. If the inbound or outbound packet rate for an IPv4
        address exceeds a configured threshold, an e-mail to this effect is
        sent out, which includes a snippet of traffic to and from the IPv4
        address. Sponsored by the New York Internet Company.

      * Added PJL sensor module (sensor/modules/pjl), which parses Printer Job
        Language/PostScript printer jobs and writes various useful information
        about them to disk. Sponsored by Ecological, LLC.

    * Tools:

      * Added tools/deleteRecords for deleting records from Berkeley DB Recno
        databases.

      * Added tools/dumpPJL for displaying data written by the PJL sensor
        module.

      * tools/dumpHTTP:

        * Added the -cI and -sI command-line options for filtering messages by
          client and server IPv4 addresses, respectively.

  * Bug fixes:

    * Libraries:

      * Sensor SMTP library (sensor/include/smtp.*):

        * SMTP error messages from previous attempts to send mail are no longer
          carried over and prepended to new ones.

        * Fixed a bug that caused all e-mail after the first one to be sent to
          only the last configured recipient.

        * The value of the "from" configuration parameter should not be sent as
          the SMTP envelope sender, as that has the possibility of violating
          RFC 2821. Consequently, the "from" configuration parameter has been
          replaced by the "senderName" and "senderAddress" parameters, from
          which a correct envelope sender and "From" message header will be
          generated.

      * Shared address library (shared/include/address.*):

        * The binaryMAC() and textMAC() functions have been converted to use
          homegrown address-conversion techniques instead of ether_aton_r()
          and ether_ntoa_r(). This works around a bug in glibc 2.11.1's
          ether_ntoa_r() function that prevents it from zero-padding Ethernet
          addresses. It also works around the fact that some UNIX-like systems,
          such as Mac OS X 10.6.6, don't have the ether_aton_r() or
          ether_ntoa_r() functions.

    * Sensor:

      * Fixed a potential crash when a malformed TCP packet is captured.

      * Fixed ICMP payload size calculation.

    * Sensor modules:

      * HTTP (sensor/modules/http):

        * Fixed a crash.

    * Tools

      * tools/dumpHTTP:

        * Added the -req and -res command-line options to the usage message.
          The options themselves were always present.

0.8.0 (March 1st, 2011)

  * Initial release.
